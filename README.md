# Edge AI Projects

Different projects turning edge devices into an intelligent gateways running 
efficient deep learning inference applied to computer vision and audio processing. No internet 
connection is required, everything is done locally 
on the edge device itself. Further, multiple edge devices can create a distributed AIoT network.
